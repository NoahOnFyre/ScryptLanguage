# Scrypt
Scrypt is a simple scripting language that is interpreted by a python file.
To start scripting with Scrypt, clone the repository and edit the core.scrypt file.
When you're done writing your code, drag your file onto the `interpreter.py` and watch it run.

# Usage:
Will be added soon. There's currently not enough stuff to write a documentation lol.
